My [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions

If you are actually going to try to run the code provided here, please note that:

- The solution is always in one file, and should be compiled as one file using the C++ 17 compiler (in my case GNU C++ 17: g++ -static -O2 -std=gnu++17).

- In solutions I use my C++ template for competitive programming (because I am somewhat used to it), in which I assume that input is read from file input.txt, which is in the same directory as program which reads it, and output is written into file output.txt, which is again in the same directory as program which write it. If you like to try the program in other setup (for example, you like to read input from stdin, then please add/modify some line(s) in main() function, or create that env variable mentioned there).
